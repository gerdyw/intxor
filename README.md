# intXor
A script that plots the equation z = x XOR y, where XOR is the bitwise exclusive OR operation. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires:
* Python v3.6.2 or greater
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
  ```
  pip install matplotlib
  ```
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
  ```
   pip install numpy
  ```

### Installing
Once you have installed the required libraries, simply download the script and run with Python 3 v3.6.2 or greater.

### Running
The script generates 360 pngs of the plot as it orbits it, each one 1 degree further round than the last. You can modify the script by removing the for loop and replacing it with
```
plt.show()
```

which opens a window where you can look around it with the mouse.
